        <p>Oceans are absorbing most of the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gases, leading to rising temperatures. This has severe consequences for marine life, coral reefs, and weather patterns. Warmer waters hold less oxygen, creating "dead zones" where marine life cannot survive.
            Coastal development, pollution, and climate change are destroying critical marine habitats like mangroves, seagrass beds, and coral reefs.
            Even worse the micro plastics can become denser in areas making more “dead zones”
            </p>
        <p>"Our vision is to restore and safeguard our oceans. Imagine an ecosystem without rubbish, without whales getting clogged up in trash, or turtles stuck on the beach because of trash sticking to their flippers. Everyone wants to help that, but without knowing, we are often doing just the opposite. But we is going to change just that.
            With our tech and your help and contribution we can save our precious oceans" </p>
